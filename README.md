Look at this great article on Medium => [53 Python Interview Questions and Answers](https://towardsdatascience.com/53-python-interview-questions-and-answers-91fa311eec3f)

The goal of this lab is to work through each of the 53 questions.
And for you to end up with a killer Python notebook with lots of interview questions that will help you land a job.
Put them in the notebook, one by one.

When there is code with a question, type it in, run it and see the answers agree.
Only type in the explanations when you think you'll hve trouble remembering them when you look at the notebook later.
